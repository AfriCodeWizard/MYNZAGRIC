Diseases: Avocado root rot/Phytophthora cinnamomi (attacks trees of any size, leaves become small pale/yellow green and wilted, branches die-back, feeder roots blackened and decayed), Anthracnose/Colletotrichum gloeosporioides (major post-harvest problem, appears as sunken spots on fruit, can penetrate deep into flesh, develops rapidly in storage), Scab/Sphaceloma perseae (infects young tissues, lesions appear as small dark spots giving corky appearance, fruits only susceptible when young), Cercospora leaf & fruit spot/Pseudocercospora purpurea (lesions appear as small light-yellow spots becoming reddish brown and hard, causes ragged holes in leaves), Bacterial soft rot/Erwinia carotovora (infected fruit has darkened metallic sheen, flesh is grey to black and soft with putrid smell), Stem end rot (dark brown to black rot begins at stem end, produces dark streaking of water-conducting tissues). Pruning: All suckers and dead branches are removed from main trunk branches. The canopy is pruned to keep the tree to a height of 5-8 m and for ease of picking. Pruning should however be minimized because the tree is very susceptible to sunburn. Weeding: The area around the tree should be kept clean by weeding and removal of all fallen fruits. Weeds compete for growth factors like nutrients and water and harbour pests and diseases.",

      watering: "Water is critically essential when growing strawberries. The plants need a lot of water especially when the runners and flowers are developing. Drip irrigation is highly recommended as it waters at the root. Keep soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Strawberries are very easy to maintain.",
      sunlight: "Require 6-10 hours of direct sunlight each day. They do well in levelled or slightly higher grounds.",
      soil: "Strawberry farming does best in areas whose soil pH is 5.5-6.5. The soil should be well drained and weed-free. Planting: Till the land and remove weeds. Construct raised beds. Prepare planting holes deep enough to accommodate the entire root system without bending it. Plant seedlings at a spacing of 20 inches apart and 4 feet between rows. The roots should be covered, but the crown should be right at the soil surface.",
      temperature: "The crop thrives in hot climate and does not tolerate frost or extremely low temperatures. Strawberry farming in Kenya is done outdoors. However, for better performance, greenhouses are recommended because they protect the plants from drought and excess rain.",
      fertilizer: "Application of fertilizers and manure boost production. However, if too much fertilizer is applied, this promotes excessive leaf growth and poor production of flower stalks. Too much nitrogen results in soft and easily-damaged strawberries. NPK 5-10-10 during fruiting.",

Diseases: Leaf blight (occurs on older leaves, large circular to oval reddish-purple spots form, develop brown centers bordered by purple zones, black fungal growth in center), Leaf spot (symptoms begin as round purple spots on upper leaf surfaces, center becomes tan/gray then almost white with purple border, can attack petioles and fruit stalks), Leak (infected ripe berry remains unchanged at first then changes to light brown, becomes soft and watery and collapses flat with juice running out, covered with white fluffy cottony fungal growth), Leaf blotch (characterized by purplish to brown blotches and large necrotic spots, often wedge-shaped on leaflet ends, can attack fruit stalk and fruit), Gray mold/Botrytis (major fruit rot disease, starts as blossom blight, progresses to berries stems and leaves, covered with gray masses of spores in damp weather), Leathery rot (occurs on green or ripe fruits, rotted area is light brown in center shading into purple at edge, fruit becomes tough and leathery in late stages), Anthracnose fruit rot (symptoms appear as soft to firm brown to black spots on green fruits and dark purple spots on ripe fruits, spots enlarge rapidly, surface covered with pink to orange spore masses), Powdery mildew (causes infected leaflets to curl upwards along margins, lower leaf surface may turn reddish, fruit infection shows as tan to rusty pink berry surface that often cracks). Varieties: Chandler, Tribute, Tristar, Tioga Selva, Domail, Rabunda, Pajaro, Douglas. Cultural Practices: Mulching - after planting the strawberry plants, mulching the beds with pine needles, shredded leaves or straw helps to keep the soil temperature down, mitigate the weed problem, and also keeps the fruit cleaner by keeping the strawberries off of the dirt. As the mulch breaks down, it also adds organic matter to the soil. Weeding - weeds compete with the plants for nutrients, moisture, space and sunlight, as well as harbouring pathogens. Manual weeding is recommended. However, during critical growth periods, i.e., flowering, fruiting, daughter plant growth and establishment, weeding should not be done. This is in order to avoid any disturbances. Training - strawberries are sprawling plants and the seedlings send out runners. These runners should be trained in order to follow a specific pattern for better performance. Irrigation - water is critically essential when growing strawberries. The plants need a lot of water especially when the runners and flowers are developing. Drip irrigation is highly recommended as it waters at the root. Pruning - this is majorly aimed at increasing fruit production. Flowers should be pruned off immediately they appear.",

The fruits also tend to shrivel and suffer chilling injuries when refrigerated. The fruit is twisted until the stalk snaps off or cut with a sharp knife.",
      pests: "Varieties: The major papaya varieties grown are Solo Sunrise, Makia, Calina, and Red Royal. Growing of this fruit has generally increased in hot areas. Diseases: Bunchy Top Virus - This is a viral infection spread by leaf hoppers (Empoasca stevensii). Symptoms include oil streaks on stem, yellowing of upper leaves, bunching and stunting of top leaves and death of plant top. Anthracnose - It's a fungal infection caused by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. This infection starts as small round dark spots on ripening portion of fruit. As fruits ripen, spots enlarge to form circular sunken areas. Papaya Ring Spot Virus - It's a viral infection in papaya spread by aphids. Leaves roll upwards, affected leaves are light green with oily streaks on mature papaya. Powdery Mildew - Characterized by whitish powder on the leaf surface. It reduces photosynthetic efficiency, and leads to yellowing and leaf fall. Damping Off and Root Rot - This is a damaging fungal infection caused by Pythium (Pythium aphardematum). This leads to stem and root rot leading to yellowing, leaf and fruit fall and subsequent death and toppling. Proper sanitation and plant drenching procedures are key to ensure disease-free production. Pests: Papaya Fruit Flies - Two species of fruit flies have been recorded from papaya in East Africa, namely Bactrocera invadens and Ceratitis rosa. Fruit flies usually deposit their eggs in ripe fruit. Some fruit flies lay eggs on green pawpaw, but most of the eggs die due to the latex secreted when fruits are punctured by females while laying eggs. Developing larvae cause rotting of ripening fruits. Fruit flies are a major concern of papaya-importing countries. Spider Mites - Mites do not spare the papaya fruits. They attack the underside of plant leaves causing yellowing, discoloration thus compromising the quality. Spider mites attack mostly during dry weather. Whiteflies - Whiteflies have become a modern threat for papaya farming. They attack the leaves causing yellowing of leaves. The whiteflies also lead to honeydew formation/sooty mold which reduced the fruit quality, color and taste. Bugs - Various types of bugs attack the pawpaw plant. Bugs suck the plant sap causing the plants to turn yellow. They also make silvery marks and white deposits on the leaves and fruits reducing the quality. Mealybugs are the major threat in papaya production.",

      soil: "The best soils are sandy loams, slightly acidic (pH 5-6.5). Altitudes of sea level up to 1,200m are suitable, making coastal Kenya the best zone, though parts of Eastern Kenya can also support the crop. Land Preparation: Clear the land and dig planting holes 60cm wide and 60cm deep. Mix topsoil with 20kg of well-decomposed manure. Plant at the onset of rains for best establishment.",
      temperature: "Cashew trees grow best in warm, coastal climates. Ideal temperatures range from 25-35°C. For counties along the Coast where rainfall is low and soils are sandy, cashews offer the perfect match: a hardy, drought-tolerant crop that thrives where others fail.",
      fertilizer: "Apply organic manure once a year. For mature trees, top-dress with a little NPK (10:10:10) before flowering. Manure and fertilizer application should be done during the growing season to support healthy growth and nut production.",
      spacing: "Spacing should be about 10m by 10m, since cashew trees spread widely. This spacing allows for proper growth, airflow, and management while accommodating the tree's spreading canopy.",
      timeToFruit: "Cashew trees start flowering in the third year for grafted varieties, though full production comes in years 5-7. Each tree can produce 7-15 kg of nuts per season, depending on care. Cashew is propagated from grafted seedlings, which mature faster and give higher yields than wild varieties. In Kenya, grafted seedlings go for around KSh 150-300 each, depending on the nursery. Cashew trees are long-term investments. Once established, they can produce for 30-40 years, offering steady income with relatively low maintenance.",
      pests: "Common Challenges: Pests and Diseases - Cashew nut pest (Helopeltis bug) and powdery mildew reduce yields if not controlled. Spraying with neem-based or recommended pesticides helps. Post-harvest Handling: Poor drying and storage cause aflatoxin and low quality. Market Fluctuations: Prices can drop if too many farmers sell raw nuts instead of processed ones. Caring for Cashew Trees: Weeding - Keep the base of the tree weed-free, especially when young. Pruning - Train the tree to a strong main stem and cut off weak or diseased branches. This improves airflow and reduces pest attack. Market Opportunities: In Kenya, processed nuts fetch between KSh 700-1,200 per kilo, with higher-grade exports going for even more. Apart from the nut, the apple can be processed into juice, wine, or jam, adding extra income streams. Locally, demand is strong from processors and nut companies based in Coast and Nairobi. With value addition, profits multiply, roasted and packaged cashews fetch nearly double the price of raw nuts. On the export side, India, Vietnam, and the Middle East are major markets. Harvesting: Harvesting involves collecting fallen apples and separating the nut. The nuts are dried before shelling. The apples, often wasted, can be sold fresh in local markets or processed into juice and wine. For farmers in Kenya's Coast, planting cashew nuts today is like planting a bank account that pays dividends for decades.",

      watering: "Olives are low-maintenance once established. The tree is hardy and tolerates drought, but poor drainage can kill it. Water the young trees regularly during the first two years, then gradually reduce as they adapt. Mulching helps retain soil moisture and suppress weeds.",
      sunlight: "Olive trees need 6–8 hours of direct sunlight daily—plant them where they can soak up the sun! Full sun exposure is essential for optimal growth and fruit production.",
      soil: "Well-drained, slightly alkaline, sandy-loam soils with good drainage are preferred. Sandy or loamy soils with a pH between 6 and 8 are ideal. If your land can grow coffee or grapes, it can likely grow olives too. Planting: Dig deep and wide - prepare a hole at least 60cm deep and 60cm wide. Improve the soil by mixing compost or well-rotted manure to enrich your topsoil before planting.",
      temperature: "Olives thrive in regions with long, dry summers and mild, wet winters — conditions similar to parts of Machakos, Kajiado, Laikipia, and parts of Nakuru. They do best at altitudes between 1,200 and 2,000 meters above sea level, where temperatures rarely drop below 7°C or rise above 35°C.",
      fertilizer: "Fertilize with organic manure and a light NPK mix, especially nitrogen, to support steady growth. Apply organic manure and balanced NPK during the growing season.",
      spacing: "For home gardens, space trees at least 4–5 meters apart. This allows for proper growth and easy management.",
      timeToFruit: "3-4 years from planting. Maturity typically occurs within this timeframe.",
      pests: "Pests: Olive fruit fly (lays eggs in olives, larvae bore into fruit causing premature drop and reduced oil quality), Olive moth (affects leaves, buds, and flowers, with third generation damaging fruit), Scale insects (black scale and oleander scale feed on sap, leading to yellowing and leaf decay), Weevils (olive tree weevil causes damage to trunks and branches), Olive lace bug (sucks sap, causing yellowing and defoliation). Diseases: Olive knot (bacterial disease creating tumor-like galls on branches causing dieback), Verticillium wilt (soilborne fungus causing wilting, yellowing leaves, and tree decline), Olive leaf spot/scab (fungal disease causing dark spots on leaves leading to defoliation), Anthracnose (fungal disease creating sunken lesions on fruit, leaves, and twigs), Phytophthora root rot (disease linked to poor drainage causing root problems, wilting, and yellow foliage). Annual pruning after harvest keeps the canopy open, allowing light penetration and easy harvesting. Remove suckers and diseased branches promptly. Market: Demand for locally produced olive oil in Kenya is rising, driven by health awareness and Mediterranean-style diets. One liter of extra virgin olive oil requires roughly 4–5 kilograms of fruit. A small-scale farmer with 200 mature trees can produce hundreds of liters per year. Export prospects are promising for regional production.",

      watering: "Coconuts are drought-tolerant, but water stress reduces fruiting. Young trees especially need regular watering for the first 2-3 years. Farmers in dry areas can use mulching to conserve soil moisture. Annual rainfall between 1,000-2,500 mm is ideal. Ensure consistent moisture, as it is crucial for good yields. Water new saplings well and be prepared to irrigate, especially during dry spells. Soil moisture very often limits coconut production in those areas where long spell of dry weather prevail or where the rainfall is scanty and ill-distributed, so irrigate the palms during summer months in basins around the palm. The irrigation requirement varies according to the soil type and climatic condition. Generally, an adult palm requires 600 to 800 liters of water once in four to seven days at 10-20 cm depth. In coastal sandy soils, sea water can be used for irrigating adult palms. Do not irrigate seedlings and very young palms up to 2 years with sea water.",
      sunlight: "Full sun (6+ hours).",
      soil: "Coconuts thrive in warm, humid climates, which is why they dominate the Kenyan coast. They also do well in areas that experience salty winds and sandy soils—conditions that would harm many other crops. Site selection: Choose well-drained sandy, loamy, or alluvial soils with a pH between 5.0 and 8.0, ideally in areas with high humidity and temperatures between 25-30°C. Before planting: Clear the land. Dig pits about 2ft x 2ft x 2ft. Mix topsoil with 20-30 kg of well-rotted manure. Well-drained, sandy soil.",
      temperature: "Coconuts thrive in warm, humid climates. Temperatures of 25-32°C and annual rainfall between 1,000-2,500 mm are ideal. Ideally in areas with high humidity and temperatures between 25-30°C. Warm (25-32°C).",
      fertilizer: "Nutrient needs per tree: Year 1-3: 200-300g of NPK 17:17:17 split in two applications. Mature trees: 1-2 kg of NPK plus organic manure annually. Add extra potassium (Muriate of Potash) for more nuts and higher oil content. Use cow manure and limestone powder as a mature plant fertilizer. Regular manure application from the first year of planting is essential to achieve higher productivity. For coconut 20-50 kg organic manure should be applied per palm per year when soil moisture content is high. Different forms of organic manures like compost, farm yard manure, bone meal, fish meal, groundnut cake could be made use for this purpose. NPK 10-10-10, apply 3x yearly.",
      spacing: "Spacing between plants: 5 metres by 5-6 metres. Maintain a spacing of 5 metres by 5 meters between dwarf coconut trees and row to row spacing.",
      timeToFruit: "Maturity: 3 years. Dwarf varieties mature in 2.5-3 years, produce more nuts per year than tall varieties, and are easier to harvest due to their shorter height. Tall varieties (e.g., East African Tall): Live up to 80 years, bear fruit after 6-10 years. Dwarf varieties: Shorter lifespan (30-40 years), start fruiting earlier (3-5 years), and are easier to harvest.",
      pests: "Pests: Rhinoceros beetles (bore into trunks and damage fronds, control by destroying breeding sites like rotting logs and using traps), Red palm weevils (bore into trunks and damage fronds, control by destroying breeding sites and using traps), Caterpillars (bore into trunks and damage fronds, control by destroying breeding sites and using traps), Black headed caterpillar (major insect pest), Cockchafer beetle (major insect pest), Coreid bug (major insect pest). Diseases: Lethal yellowing disease (major threat causing premature nut drop and yellowing leaves, planting resistant varieties and removing infected trees helps reduce spread), Bud Rot, Leaf Rot, Stem Bleeding, Root Wilt. Planting Material: Coconut is propagated through seedlings raised from selected seed nuts. Generally 9 to 12 month old seedlings are used for planting. Select seedlings, which have 6-8 leaves and 10-12 cm collar girth when they are 9-12 month old. Early splitting of leaves is another criteria in the selection of coconut seedling. Planting: Before planting: Clear the land. Dig pits about 2ft x 2ft x 2ft. Mix topsoil with 20-30 kg of well-rotted manure. To plant, dig a pit 2 meters wide, long, and high. Fill the pit with a mixture of soil, cow manure, neem cake powder, and limestone powder for the first meter. Plant the seedling and water it thoroughly. Benefits: Faster maturity (2.5-3 years vs 5-6 years for tall varieties), Higher yields (over 250 nuts per tree annually vs 80-100 nuts of tall varieties), Easier harvesting (shorter height 5-7 meters), Improved nut quality (higher oil content up to 68%, greater amount of coconut water). Every part of the coconut tree has value: the fruit, oil, husk, shell, leaves, and even the trunk. Farmers call it the 'tree of life' because it provides food, income, and materials all year round. Inter-Cropping: Schedule for inter-mixed cropping may be drawn up based on the canopy size and orientation of palms. A variety of intercrops like pineapple, banana, groundnut, chilies, sweet potato and different vegetables can be raised in coconut garden. In older plantation cinnamon, pepper, clove, nutmeg among others can be grown as mixed crops. However, these inter mixed crops are to be adequately and separately manured. Harvesting: Unlike seasonal crops, coconuts produce all year round. A mature tree yields 30-80 nuts annually, depending on care and variety. Signs nuts are ready: Water coconuts: 6-7 months old (for drinking). Mature nuts: 11-12 months old (for copra, oil, or desiccated coconut). Harvesting is often done manually—climbing the trees with ropes or using long poles with hooks. Dwarf varieties and hybrids make this easier. Twelve months old nuts are harvested at the interval of 30-45 days for seed as well as copra making and culinary purposes. For household use keep the nuts in vertical direction. However, for tender nut purposes 7 to 8 months old nuts are harvested. The nuts can be harvested using coconut climbers. Nuts which are 11 months old give fiber of good quality. This is suitable for coir fiber. Market: Despite this potential, Kenya still imports coconut oil and related products, meaning there's room for farmers and investors to grow the industry locally.",
