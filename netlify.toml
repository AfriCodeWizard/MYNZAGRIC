# Netlify configuration for Identity/Git Gateway only
# This site is hosted on Vercel, but uses Netlify for Identity/Git Gateway services
#
# IMPORTANT: After creating the Netlify site, you MUST remove the Next.js plugin
# from the Netlify UI (Site settings → Build & deploy → Plugins → Remove @netlify/plugin-nextjs)
# The plugin cannot be disabled via this config file - it must be removed manually from the UI.
